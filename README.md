### Hello, and welcome to my profile! :wave:
I recently graduated from RIT in May of 2023 with bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering. My most recent coursework and interests lie in robotics and image & signal processing. My current research brings the areas of robotics, computer vision and machine learning together.

I previously had a six-month co-op positions at Collins Aerospace and Amazon Robotics, where I worked as a Hardware Design Engineer and Hardware Quality & Reliability Engineer respectively. I am thankful for the experience I gained at both of these companies.

I am currently seeking a full time electrical engineering position, preferably in the robotics or signal processing fields.
