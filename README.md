### Hello, and welcome to my profile!
I will be graduating from RIT in May of 2023 with bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering. My most recent coursework and interests lie in robotics and image & signal processing. My current research brings the areas of robotics, computer vision and machine learning together.

I previously had a six-month co-op position at Collins Aerospace, where I worked as a Hardware Design Engineer. I am thankful for the experience I gained in part selection, circuit design, test and verification, documentation and more.

I am seeking another six-month co-op position in electrical engineering, audio signal processing or robotics fields preferred. Available August 2022.
